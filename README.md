This was one of my first attempts at creating a website utilizing basic html and css. In this project, I created a series navigate-able pages each with their own unique content, images, and input elements. With this, I was able to produce functionality such as expanding, clickable images, upload gifs, utilize forms for user interaction, create multiple methods of navigating between pages, and more.

While remaining very simple on the surface, this project serves as an example of my understanding of the basic uses of htmml and css regarding the building and styling of a website and my improvement since then.
